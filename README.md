# Coduno's Core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coduno/core.png)](https://travis-ci.org/coduno/core)

This is a coding competition platform, executing submitted code of multiple contestants within the same runtime.

Most of the work was done at the [Institute of Networked and Embedded Systems](http://nes.aau.at/) of the [University of Klagenfurt](http://aau.at/), funded by the [Austrian Research Promotion Agency](http://ffg.at/en).

It is still in an experimental stage. The website wrapping a user interface around the bare core you see here, is at [coduno/app](https://github.com/coduno/app).

## Building

    gradle jar

To generate `coduno.jar` with dependencies in it.
